{"text": "ChRIS (ChRIS Research Integration Service) is an open-source platform for orchestrating data and computation across diverse environments, originally developed at Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital. It facilitates containerized, non-interactive applications for medical image research.", "metadata": {"source": "chris-overview.md", "section": "Overview", "tags": ["ChRIS", "medical imaging", "distributed computing", "OpenShift"]}}
{"text": "ChRIS uses Linux containers to standardize and isolate computation. Applications called 'plugins' run inside containers and can be chained into pipelines. The system supports easy reuse of analysis software across local, HPC, or cloud environments.", "metadata": {"source": "chris-overview.md", "section": "Architecture", "tags": ["plugins", "containers", "pipelines", "HPC", "cloud"]}}
{"text": "Plugins in ChRIS are registered through the ChRIS Store and executed via the backend components: pfcon, pfioh, and pman. These services distribute jobs to OpenShift clusters for scalable execution using Kubernetes Jobs.", "metadata": {"source": "chris-overview.md", "section": "Deeper dive into how ChRIS works", "tags": ["plugin", "OpenShift", "Kubernetes", "pfcon", "pman", "pfioh"]}}
{"text": "ChRIS enables real-time collaboration and secure data sharing using Swift/Ceph. It provides strong isolation using SELinux, namespaces, and OpenShift networking, which helps maintain data privacy in clinical contexts.", "metadata": {"source": "chris-overview.md", "section": "Need", "tags": ["collaboration", "data sharing", "security", "privacy", "SELinux"]}}
{"text": "The Multi-Party Computation (MPC) plugin in ChRIS enables hospitals to compute over encrypted brain imaging data without revealing raw patient data. It leverages the Conclave Cloud Dataverse for secure MPC jobs.", "metadata": {"source": "chris-overview.md", "section": "Multi-Party Computation Example", "tags": ["MPC", "encryption", "privacy", "conclave", "dataverse"]}}
{"text": "ChRIS integrates with PACS servers and provides plugins like PACSPull and FreeSurfer to automate MRI data retrieval and brain segmentation. Outputs include 2D/3D visualizations and z-score heatmaps for analysis.", "metadata": {"source": "chris-overview.md", "section": "Example: Multi-Party Computation", "tags": ["PACS", "FreeSurfer", "MRI", "zscore", "heatmap"]}}
