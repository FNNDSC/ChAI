## 🧠 Clinical Considerations and Next Steps

Given the following:
- Right-dominant fatigue and discomfort  
- Gradual worsening over multiple years  
- Physical exam findings suggesting asymmetry  
- No traumatic incident or clear trigger

...a structural or biomechanical root cause is suspected.

### Diagnostic Imaging Ordered
- **Modality**: Standing AP Pelvis X-ray and full-leg CT-based scanogram  
- **Goal**: Evaluate for pelvic tilt, joint alignment, spinal compensation, or possible limb length discrepancy

The imaging results will inform the next steps in management, including physical therapy, corrective devices, or advanced interventions if necessary.
