# Leg Length Discrepancy (LLD): Clinical Overview

---

## 🦵 What is Leg Length Discrepancy?

**Leg Length Discrepancy (LLD)** refers to a condition where the two lower limbs differ in length. This can lead to various biomechanical, postural, and musculoskeletal issues depending on the degree of the discrepancy.

- **Normal variation**: Up to 1 cm is considered common and usually asymptomatic.
- **Clinically significant**: >2 cm often results in functional or postural changes.

## 🔍 Types of Leg Length Discrepancy

### 1. **Structural (Anatomical) LLD**
- Actual shortening of bones (femur, tibia)
- Often caused by:
  - Congenital limb deformities
  - Fractures during childhood
  - Growth plate injuries
  - Bone infections or tumors

### 2. **Functional (Apparent) LLD**
- Leg bones are equal, but asymmetry arises from:
  - Pelvic tilt
  - Hip/knee joint contractures
  - Muscle tightness (e.g., IT band)
  - Scoliosis

> ⚠️ Functional LLD can often be corrected without surgery if root cause is addressed.

## 🚨 Symptoms of LLD

The severity and presentation depend on the degree and duration of discrepancy.

### Common Symptoms:
- Pelvic tilt or uneven hips
- Visible limp or altered gait
- Lower back pain (often chronic)
- Hip, knee, or ankle discomfort
- Uneven wear on shoes
- Postural scoliosis
- Leg fatigue after activity

### Secondary Effects:
- Compensatory curvature of the spine
- Increased joint load on the longer leg
- Recurrent strain injuries (e.g., IT band syndrome)

---

## 📏 Diagnostic Approaches

### Physical Examination
- Visual gait analysis
- Palpation for pelvic asymmetry
- Block test (heel lift trial)

### Imaging Modalities
- **X-ray (AP pelvis)**: For pelvic alignment
- **Scanogram** (CT or MRI-based): Precise bone length
- **EOS imaging**: Low-dose full-body alignment scan

## 🤖 Role of AI in Diagnosis

### Tools like `pl-lld_inference` assist clinicians by:
- Automatically detecting anatomical landmarks
- Generating heatmaps of limb alignment
- Measuring bone length discrepancies with high accuracy
- Suggesting confidence scores for clinical decisions

> Example Output: “Right leg: 87.9 cm, Left leg: 90.0 cm → Discrepancy: 2.1 cm (structural)”

## 🧠 Clinical Reasoning & When to Suspect LLD

LLD should be considered when:
- There’s persistent unilateral joint pain (e.g., right hip or left knee)
- Physical therapy doesn’t resolve gait abnormalities
- Back pain is associated with asymmetrical standing or walking
- Visual inspection shows pelvic or spinal tilt

## 📈 Classification by Severity

| Discrepancy     | Severity | Common Symptoms                |
|------------------|----------|--------------------------------|
| <1.0 cm          | Normal   | Often asymptomatic             |
| 1.0–2.0 cm       | Mild     | Possible gait/posture issues   |
| 2.0–3.0 cm       | Moderate | Likely symptoms, clinical impact |
| >3.0 cm          | Severe   | High impact, surgical consideration |

## 🩺 Treatment Options

### Non-Surgical
- **Shoe lifts** (internal or external)
- **Physiotherapy**: Postural correction, gait retraining
- **Manual therapy**: Pelvic realignment
- **Activity modification**: Reduce joint overload

### Surgical
- **Epiphysiodesis** (growth plate closure in children)
- **Leg lengthening procedures**
- **Osteotomy** (bone realignment or shortening)

## 💬 Common Patient Questions

- “Why do I feel uneven when I walk?”
- “Can leg length differences cause back pain?”
- “Will I need surgery if one leg is shorter?”
- “How do I know if my hips are misaligned?”
- “What imaging should I ask for to confirm LLD?”

These are typically addressed via clinical exam, imaging, and sometimes AI-assisted analysis.

## 📚 Real-Life Case Snapshot

> A 26-year-old male presenting with lower back pain and a noticeable limp was diagnosed with a **2.1 cm structural LLD** using full-leg CT scanogram and AI-based landmark detection. Conservative management (shoe lift + PT) was recommended.
