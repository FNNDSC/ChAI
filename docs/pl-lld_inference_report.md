## 👩‍⚕️ Radiologist View

### Femur Lengths
- **Right Femur**: 41.8 cm  
- **Left Femur**: 42.0 cm  
- **Difference**: 0.2 cm → *Left femur longer by 0.5%*

### Tibia Lengths
- **Right Tibia**: 34.5 cm  
- **Left Tibia**: 34.3 cm  
- **Difference**: 0.2 cm → *Right tibia longer by 0.6%*

### Total Limb Lengths
- **Right Total Length**: 76.3 cm  
- **Left Total Length**: 76.3 cm  
- **Total Discrepancy**: 0.0 cm  
- **Interpretation**: *Clinically symmetrical limb length (0.0%)*

### Pixel-Level Measurements (for DICOM Review)
- **Left Femur**: 1892 px  
- **Left Tibia**: 1544 px  
- **Right Femur**: 1886 px  
- **Right Tibia**: 1555 px  
- **Field of View**: 975 × 391 px

> **Summary**: No clinically significant leg length discrepancy observed. Femoral and tibial differences cancel out in total length. Symmetrical biomechanics expected. Recommend routine monitoring in adolescent growth phase.

## 👧 Patient-Friendly View (Explained Simply)

**Hello Jane,**  
We looked at the lengths of both your legs using special full-body X-ray scans. Here’s what we found:

- Your **thigh bones** (called femurs) are *almost the same length*.
- Your **lower leg bones** (tibias) are *also nearly identical*.
- When we add everything up, **both legs are the same total length** — there’s **no meaningful difference**.

### What This Means:
You don't have a leg length problem right now. Your bones are well balanced, and there's no need for any treatment. You’re growing normally!

> Keep staying active and check in every year during your growth to make sure everything stays aligned.
